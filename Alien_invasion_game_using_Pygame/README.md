# Alien_invasion_game_using_Pygame

For this project, I have created an alien invasion game using **Pygame**. The aim of the game is to shoot down the alien fleet that is trying to invade earth, using your spaceship. This game has all the basic functionalities of an arcade game. The game tells you the level you are on, the highest score, your score and how many ships you have left. The difficulty of the game increases as you shoot down an entire fleet. Clone the repository alien_invasion and run **python3 alien_invasion.py** to play the game. Attached is one screenshot from the game.
