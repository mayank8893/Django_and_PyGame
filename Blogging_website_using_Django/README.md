# Blogging_website_using_Django
The aim of this project was to create a blogging website using the Django library in python. I have created a website to write and save blogs using **Django** and gave it a simple and professional appearance using **Bootstrap library and the django-bootstrap3 app**. I then deployed this project to **Heroku's** server so anyone can access it. I used **Git** to commit the working project to a repository and then pushed the repository to Heroku's servers. I also added **securtiy features** to this application. Please visit **https://blog-post-moon.herokuapp.com** to see the website and write your own blogs. The source code used to create this website is uploaded with this repository. Here are a few screenshots of the website showing some basic funtionalities.
